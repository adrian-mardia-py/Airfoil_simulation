# Thin Airfoil Flow Simulation with GPU Acceleration

This project simulates the aerodynamic interference of a thin airfoil using **linear potential theory** and **GPU parallelization**.

## Overview
The analysis of thin airfoils can be simplified by replacing the camber line with a distribution of vortices that "bend" the airflow.  
Since the governing equations (Laplaceâ€™s equation) are linear, the total flow solution can be expressed as the sum of independent elemental solutions.  

This property makes the problem highly suitable for **parallel computing on GPUs**.

## Methodology
The implementation follows these steps:
1. **Vortex contribution**:  
   - For each vortex, its induced velocity field is calculated.  
   - The contribution is stored as a layer of a 3D matrix.  

2. **Field superposition**:  
   - All layers are summed using **atomic operations**.  
   - The free-stream velocity is added to obtain the total flow field.  

3. **Vortex strength calculation**:  
   - The intensity of each vortex is computed using optimized routines decorated with `@njit` from the **Numba** library.  

4. **Streamline visualization**:  
   - The module `PruebasCurvasNivel.py` evaluates streamlines in the flow field.  
   - Only the central streamlines are highlighted, clearly showing how most streamlines are deflected below the airfoil, producing the **high-pressure region responsible for lift**.  

## Technical Details
- All GPU operations are executed using **`np.float32` precision**, which provides the best performance with CUDA.  
- Parallelization is achieved with **Numba CUDA** kernels.  
- Visualization is handled with Python plotting tools.  

## Requirements
- Python 3.9+  
- Numba  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
